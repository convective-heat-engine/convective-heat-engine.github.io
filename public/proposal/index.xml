      <description>Background #  If the problem resides in changes to the atmosphere, a lasting solution must be directed towards this source. The primary driver of climate change is deemed to be increases in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. This leads to a reduction in infra-red (IR) radiation to space, resulting in a slight warming of the atmosphere. This warming leads to the atmosphere having an increased capacity to hold water vapor, which is a more potent greenhouse gas (GHG) than CO2, amplifying the problem of slowing the IR radiation of surface heat.</description>

      <description>Appendix I – Urbanization Implications #  Global population is trending towards increasing urbanization, with some 55% of the global population living in urbanized locales as of 2018, with the recent urbanization rate being around 800 million people per decade.
This trend, coupled with a summer Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect of 1.9°C and winter SUHI of 0.87°C (USA results) demonstrates that the majority of humans are living in environments that are warmer than the natural surroundings.</description>

      <description>Appendix II - Relevant Atmospheric Processes #  Heat flux through the atmosphere as summarized in Kiehl, Trenberth (2009)
Surface heat is transported vertically by the following means: reflection, thermals, evapotranspiration and net difference between surface radiation and back radiation.
The direct surface heat transfer processes relevant to this proposal are thermals and evapotranspiration. Back radiation can be affected over a longer timeframe by the improvements to the efficiency of photosynthetic processes as a result of the deployment of the technology proposed herein.</description>

      <description>Description of the Convective Head Engine (CHE) #  Convection in Water (Incompressible Fluid) v Convection in Air (Compressible Fluid)
A vertical column of water instantiated in the atmosphere thermally separates in the opposite direction to the atmosphere. Buoyancy forces result in the warmest water rising to the top of the column and coldest sinking to the bottom, whereas the atmosphere has the warmest air at the surface and coldest air at altitude.</description>

      <description>Introduction #  The climate /energy nexus has received much attention in recent decades. The concern has hinged around a rise in measured atmospheric CO2 levels that has coincided with a rise in average atmospheric temperatures. Concomitant with these trends has been an increase in urbanization, with some 55% of the global population living in urban environments. Urban environments are subject to the urban heat island effect, which means that the majority of the world’s population is directly experiencing local warming greater than global averages.</description>

      <description>Concept Summary #  A new solution to the problem of Anthropogenic Climate Change (ACC) is presented. A tall structure, called a Convective Heat Engine (CHE), is conceptualized that vertically transfers surface heat by means of convection through a column of water. The temperature profile of the atmospheric column when in thermal equilibrium – that is, when no atmospheric convection is occurring– is such that the temperature of the atmosphere decreases with altitude.</description>
