## Convective Heat Engine

### Proposed Solution to Climage Change

![Transform the Desert](/images/desert-to-green-space.gif)

### Overview

We believe that turning desert into a lush green landscape is now finally possible.

The purpose of this website is to introduce a new technology, called a Convective Heat Engine (CHE).  This technology is in the conceptual stage of development.  The CHE behaves like a continuously precipitating cumulonimbus cloud, established and maintained in a vertical structure.  The CHE, as modeled, continuously transports surface heat upwards through the atmospheric column and can thus be used as a means to directly mitigate the **SYMPTOMS** of Anthropogenic (man made) Global Warming (AGW).  By continuously producing fresh water from the air, it can support plant growth, especially in arid regions.  This will remove or sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, directly addressing the **CAUSE** of AGW.  Another feature of the CHE is that it delivers cold conditions at ground level, allowing it to serve as a low temperature heat sink (condenser) capable of being used as an ultra-efficient cooling tower for power generation.

<!-- - Mega Liters of water reliably extracted from the air each day.
- Gigawatts of surface heat vented continuously.
- Increases the efficiency for power plants.
- Runs on waste heat energy from power plants. -->

### X-Prize

The estimated capital cost of a working prototype greatly exceeds the means of the founder to demonstrate the functionality of the CHE.  The recently launched [$100M X-Prize for Carbon Removal as sponsored by Elon Musk](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk) provides the ideal means to develop and showcase the CHE.  To that end, we have established a [team](/about) to showcase the CHE in the X-Prize.
