## Convective Heat Engine

### Proposed Solution to Climage Change

### Overview

<!-- We believe that turning desert into a lush green landscape is now finally possible. -->

The purpose of this website is to introduce a new technology called a Convective Heat Engine (CHE).  This technology is in the conceptual stage of development.

The CHE performs several functions, both directly through surface heat removal and power generation efficiency as well as indirectly by allowing plants to be grown in areas that have otherwise been unsuitable due to the lack of a fresh water supply that was not economically viable, such as a desert or areas prone to drought.

The CHE continuously moves Earthâ€™s surface heat upwards through the atmosphere. As a result of this warm surface air being moved to a higher altitude, the moisture contained in it is forced to condense into larger droplets and so the CHE behaves like a continuously raining cumulonimbus cloud, formed and maintained in a series of vertical towers.  The cold air flowing to the top of the tower provides a low temperature heat sink which can be used as an ultra-efficient cooling tower to improve power generation efficiency.

By continuously removing surface heat from the planet, improving power generation efficiency, and creating continuous rain from the CHE towers, it is now possible to begin to reverse Anthropogenic Global Warming.

The major benefits of the CHE:
- Continuous high-volume fresh water supply anywhere in the world
- Plant growth in arid regions of the planet
- CO2 removal from the atmosphere in large quantities
- Improved power generation efficiencies
- Stabilised planet temperatures

<!-- - Mega Liters of water reliably extracted from the air each day.
- Gigawatts of surface heat vented continuously.
- Increases the efficiency for power plants.
- Runs on waste heat energy from power plants. -->

### Plan of Action

The estimated capital cost of a working prototype greatly exceeds the means of the [CHE team](/about) to demonstrate the functionality of the CHE and so we intend to to enter the recently launched [$100M X-Prize for Carbon Removal as sponsored by Elon Musk](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk), which provides the ideal means to develop and showcase the Convective Heat Engine.
