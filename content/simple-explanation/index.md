Basic propositions that follow from high school physics:

1. Warmed air expands due to an increase in its pressure.  Air that expands has a lower density than the surrounding un-warmed air and rises / ascends
2. Expanding air cools down
3. Cooled air contracts due to a decrease in it pressure.  Air that contracts has a higher density than the surrounding un-cooled air and sinks / descends.
4. Contracting air warms up
5. In the atmosphere, the air at ground level has a higher pressure than the air at altitude.  The air at ground level is consequently generally warmer than the air at altitude.
6. Cooled air that is drawn upwards (into lower pressure air) will expand and cool further as per 2 & 5 above.
7. Warmed water that rises does NOT expand and cool like air – the warm water floats to the top of the water column and stays warm until the heat is transferred from it.
8. Cooled water sinks downwards in the water column.
9. Combining 7 & 8 means that warmer temperatures can be transferred upwards without an expansionary cooling effect by using water as the heat transfer medium. Conversely, cooler temperatures can readily be transferred downwards to ground level from altitude by again using water as the transfer medium.
10. From 5 & 7 it is seen that water columns have a temperature profile that INCREASE with altitude whilst atmospheric columns have a temperature profile the DECREASE with altitude.
11. There is also a temperature profile inside the earth.  The deeper you dig, the warmer it gets.  The average rate of temperature increase is 25°C per km.  That means that temperatures WARMER than the ground level air temperatures are available by digging down into the earth’s surface.  This is called Geo-thermal Heat.

In order to understand how the CHE works, we have to start from something that is generally well understood – the Hot Air Balloon.  It consists of the following key components:

- The Balloon – a volume of air that is warmer (less dense) than the surrounding ambient air.
- The Heat Source – a source/reservoir from which to heat the Balloon to above the surrounding ambient air temp.
- The Heat Delivery System – a delivery system to move heat from the Source to the Balloon
- The Basket – the load lifted by the Balloon that is heavier than the surrounding ambient air.
- The Rope – connecting the Basket to the Balloon

The goal with what follows is to connect elements of the CHE to the Hot Air Balloon in order for you to gain an understanding of how it works.

# The Heat Source(s)
- The surface temperature of the atmosphere, which is WARMER than the atmosphere at altitude, and can thus act as a SOURCE of heat relative to high altitude air. (from 10 above)
- Geo-thermal (from 11 above)

# The Balloon
A tall chimney like structure with fabric sides which reaches around 1000m above ground level. Here the air is some 10°C cooler than the air at ground level.  This chimney like structure will be called a Convective Uplift Tower (CUT).  The top section of the CUT serves as the Balloon.  The warmed air in the Balloon rises up the CUT as a result of propositions 1 & 2 above.

# The Heat Delivery System
Water circulating in insulated pipes, with heat exchangers situated in the Source (to collect the heat) and in the Balloon (to deliver the heat).  Note that this system will deliver surface temperatures to the Balloon (resulting in warmed air uplift) AND simultaneously deliver the cooler temperatures at the Balloon’s altitude to ground level.

# The Basket
The cooler temperatures delivered to the ground level by the Heat Delivery System is transferred to the warmer air there – cooling it down whilst simultaneously harvesting its warmer temperatures for delivery to the Balloon.  This cooled (heavier) ground level air is drawn into the bottom of the CUT by the action of the uplift of the warmed air in the Balloon.  The bottom section of the CUT serves as the Basket.  The heavier cooled air being drawn up the CUT by the Balloon is cooled further as a result of established propositions 3 & 4 above.

# The Rope
The air in the Balloon is rising up.  The air in the Basket is heavier than ambient and tends to sink.  The sides of the CUT are air tight and do not allow ingress of surrounding air.  A low pressure region is established between the rising air in the Balloon and the heavier air in the Basket.  This low pressure draws the heavier air of the Basket up with the rising air of the Balloon. The fabric sides of the CUT maintain the integrity of the low pressure region and accordingly serve as the Rope.

Now, having shown that it is possible to create convective uplift using ground level heat transferred to a higher altitude, and that such convective uplift can lead to further cooling within a CUT, we can show you with the following diagram that CUT’s can be coupled together consecutively to create even further cooling.  The more CUT’s that are coupled together, the more cooling is achieved.

How these CUT’s are designed (sized) and connected together is not straightforward – it requires careful calculations for the correct dimensions to be established.  To see how this may be done, see here (provide link to original proposal)
